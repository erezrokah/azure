# Ensure guest users are reviewed on a monthly basis (Automated)

## Profile Applicability:

- Level 1

## Description:

Azure AD is extended to include Azure AD B2B collaboration, allowing you to invite people from outside your organization to be guest users in your cloud account and sign in with their own work, school, or social identities. Guest users allow you to share your company's applications and services with users from any other organization, while maintaining control over your own corporate data.
Work with external partners, large or small, even if they don't have Azure AD or an IT department. A simple invitation and redemption process lets partners use their own credentials to access your company's resources a a guest user.

## Rationale:

Guest users in the Azure AD are generally required for collaboration purposes in Office 365, and may also be required for Azure functions in enterprises with multiple Azure tenants, Guest users should be reviewed on a regular basis, at least annually, Guest users should not be granted administrative roles where possible.
Guest users are typically added outside your employee on-boarding/off-boarding process and could potentially be overlooked indefinitely leading to a potential vulnerability.
Guest users should be review on a monthly basis to ensure that inactive and unneeded accounts are removed.
